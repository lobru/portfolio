# ImGuiColorTextEdit → "IDE-lite" — Status Update

**Date:** 2026-06-11 (updated; previous update 2026-06-05)
**Repo:** github.com/lobotomy-x/ImGuiColorTextEdit (branch `lobotomy/main`)
**Stack:** C++17 · Dear ImGui 1.92 (docking + multi-viewport) · SDL3 + SDLGPU3 · MSVC `/W4 /WX`
**Scale:** ~37k LOC across core + app files · 748 commits on the fork (+69 this cycle)

## What it is

A heavily-extended fork of `goossens/ImGuiColorTextEdit` that turns a syntax-highlighting
text-widget demo into a lightweight, self-hosting IDE. It builds itself: the editor is
developed inside the editor, with a "where is this feature's code" map that jumps to the
function that draws whatever you're looking at.

The long game is an embeddable editor core (the portable `TextEditor.cpp/.h` widget) that can
drop into other host apps — eventual ReShade / UEVR overlay builds — with the app shell
(`example/`) as the full desktop IDE.

## New this cycle (2026-06-05 → 2026-06-11, 69 commits)

### Intellisense engine — tree-sitter project index (`tsindex`, new module)
- **Background symbol index** for the whole project (C++, C#, Lua, Go, Rust grammars),
  persisted to disk for instant load + incremental rebuild on project open; powers outline,
  go-to-definition, and completion without a language server.
- **Member-aware autocomplete** — triggers on `.` / `->` / `::` and lists the receiver type's
  members. Resolves chained access: `a.b.c`, through method calls (`a.get().member`), STL
  element types (`v.front().x`, `v[i].member`, `m[k].`, `opt.value().x`), and element access
  through fields/methods (`o.vec.front().x`) — including **cross-file** chains via the index.
  Curated STL member table covers `std::vector`, `std::string`, etc.
- Perf hardened from an adversarial review: cached compiled queries, O(1) dedup, no duplicate
  buffers; headless self-test gates the chain composition end-to-end.

### LSP / clangd integration (new modules: `lsp_client`, `lsp_protocol`)
- Hand-rolled **clangd transport + JSON-RPC protocol**, proven by a dedicated headless gate
  (`lsptest`, a CTest target that skips cleanly when clangd is absent).
- **Async completion** wired into the editor with tree-sitter as instant fallback and a status
  indicator; **go-to-definition** routed through clangd (cross-file accurate, ts fallback);
  **hover** tooltips (type/signature/docs); **diagnostics** error/warning count in the status bar.

### Productization — "ImGui-IDE"
- Rebranded binary (`ImGui-IDE.exe`), app icon (Explorer + taskbar), themed UI + window title,
  Help → About dialog, attribution headers in every source file.
- **Inno Setup installer** with Windows Explorer integration and a license-acceptance page;
  README rewritten with a product section (features, build, install).

### Navigation & UX
- **Navigation history** — back/forward across go-to-definition and all jump types, with nav
  arrows hidden until there's history.
- Nav panel Ctrl-click multi-select for batch actions; exclude-from-view now also excludes from
  the symbol index; Ctrl+L selects the line for every cursor (multi-cursor aware).
- Fixes: tab right-click flicker (open on release), markdown-preview crash + dock-beside-file,
  gutter line-number highlight off-by-one, status-bar right-align/dirty-dot overlap,
  middle-click pan on all scrollable panels, multi-line `#define` bodies highlighted as code.

### Reliability & cross-platform
- Crash handler now writes a **minidump + RVA** on SEH exceptions.
- **Linux + macOS CI fixed and green** alongside Windows (guarded Windows-only code, missing
  std headers, GCC/Clang warning differences) — the editor core builds on all three.
- C# go-to-def: decompile passes the runtime dir so dependent types resolve; parsed symbols
  cached by mtime; backup folders excluded from grep/index.

## Previous cycle (to 2026-06-05)

### Editor & language tooling
- **Project navigation** tree with filters (dotfiles / code-only / excluded / flat), collapse &
  expand-all, per-file context menu, and inline rename / delete (recycle-bin safe).
- **Go-to-definition & find-references**, project-wide and grep-based (no LSP dependency), plus
  **Go-to-File** that self-discovers MSVC + Windows SDK include paths from vswhere and the
  registry — no Developer Command Prompt required.
- **Find in Files** — project-wide search panel.
- **Format Document** via clang-format with per-language brace styles, applied undo-safe.
- **Folding** for braces, Python indents, Lua keyword blocks, INI sections, C# `#region`; plus
  preprocessor highlight carried across backslash-continued lines.
- **Word wrap**, column/rectangular selection, image viewer, and a script/exe runner with
  Python venv auto-detection.
- **`.editorconfig` cascade** — per-project / per-language indent & wrap settings.

### Git integration
- Status bar branch indicator (dirty / ahead / behind), background-polled off the UI thread.
- Git menu: fetch / pull / commit / push / discard / status, plus diff-against-file.

### "Safe co-editing with an AI agent" (the headline feature)
A workflow where an external agent (e.g. Claude) edits the same files on disk while you have
them open — without losing work or losing track of who changed what:
- **External-change detection** — throttled mtime poll; clean buffers auto-reload, dirty buffers
  raise a conflict bar.
- **3-way merge** of your unsaved edits against the on-disk version over the last reconciled base
  (diff3 with conflict markers; large-file fallback).
- **Visibility layer** — fading corner toasts, a tab badge until you view the change, violet
  gutter markers on the exact changed lines (LCS diff, prefix/suffix-trimmed for speed), and a
  persistent dockable "External Changes" activity feed.

### Reliability & performance
- **Crash capture** — CRT report hook + `std::set_terminate` + SEH filter route asserts /
  exceptions / access violations to a `crash.log`, turning an un-repro'able shutdown assert into
  a self-reporting one.
- **Frame-time watchdog** — measures per-frame UI-build cost, tracks a rolling worst + slow-frame
  count, surfaced in Dev Tools and logged when over the 30 fps budget.
- Earlier perf work: O(1) visual-index fold mapping, debounced post-edit reparse (fixed a
  240→30 fps typing cliff in large files), axis-snap pan/scroll.

### UX polish
- VS-style **tab context menu**: close / close others / close left / close right (scoped to the
  tab's own dock node), split left/right, diff-with-current, reveal in explorer, copy path —
  built on ImGui internals (`DockTabItemRect`, dock-node tab bars) with right-click no longer
  stealing the active tab, and mouse-wheel scrolling the tab strip.
- Multi-viewport-aware dialogs pinned to the main viewport; rebindable two-stroke keybind system
  with a persistent app-level registry; status bar with language + toolchain selectors and an
  FPS readout.

## Notable engineering challenges solved
- **Docking-tab-bar customization** required reading ImGui internals (`ImGuiWindowTempData`,
  `ImGuiDockNode`, `ImGuiTabBar`) since the public API doesn't expose per-tab context menus —
  including pinning down that ImGui re-selects a tab on *both* mouse-down and mouse-release.
- **Concurrent-edit correctness** — picking the right 3-way merge base (a dedicated `syncedText`
  snapshot, not "content at open"), guarding self-saves with mtime re-baselining plus a
  byte-compare backstop, and clamping the restored cursor so a shrunk file can't trigger an
  out-of-range assert.
- **Self-discovering toolchains** so the app works when launched from Explorer, not just a dev
  prompt.

## Current state
The project has crossed from "extended widget demo" to **installable product**: branded
ImGui-IDE build, Windows installer, and three-platform CI. Build is green (`/W4 /WX`); headless
gates cover the non-UI logic (colorizer, folding, language mapping, member-completion chain
resolution) plus a dedicated LSP transport test (`lsptest`). Verification of visual/cursor
features remains runtime-owned — confirmed in the running app, not just by "it compiles."

The entire 2026-05 roadmap has shipped (see `.claude/roadmap.md`). Remaining open items are
one bug awaiting a Windows repro (cursor X drift on tabbed long lines) and one polish item
(distinct `///` docstring-fold preview). The fold-preview-row bug is fixed.

## Roadmap
1. Tighter live-agent integration (attribution beyond on-disk diffing).
2. Emscripten + embeddable-DLL builds toward the ReShade / UEVR overlay targets.
3. Headless GUI test coverage (ImGui Test Engine); LSP transport is already gated headless.
